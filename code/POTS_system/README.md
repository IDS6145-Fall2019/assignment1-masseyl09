## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model
The POTS model simulates water and nutrient levels of containers of various vegetables (string beans, egglplant, peppers, and bok choy). Each iteration of the simulation will report the container's water reserve and nutrient levels. The simulation will run until the water and nutrient levels drop enough that the plants die.

The class diagram below provides the interaction each class in the software has with another and the internal variables and actions for a class.
